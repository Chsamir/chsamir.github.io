 Recent developments in shape analysis and retrieval play an important role in a wide variety of applications that potentially require matching of objects with different geometries. In shape classification,  there  is no natural way to represent an object but the similarity measure, distance between representations or descriptors, depends heavily on the strategy of computing optimal correspondences. In this paper we introduce a  new numerical  method for registering   surfaces.  Thus, finding an optimal one-to-one correspondence  between their shapes.  Unfortunately, solving this type of optimization problem is generally hard  because the solutions space is nonlinear  with  no natural manifold structure on it. To overcome such limitations we make use of recent methods to represent objects then  we find optimal correspondences using a discretized approximation of the search space.  The proposed method has the advantage of  extending the Riemannian analysis of 3D curves in a natural way for  surfaces.  We demonstrate the proposed algorithms using different public datasets for   2D and 3D objects  matching and classification.
