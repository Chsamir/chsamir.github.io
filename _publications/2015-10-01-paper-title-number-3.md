In this paper, we introduce a new method for learning and regression from a finite set of noisy points on Grassmann manifolds. We propose a new Riemannian Monte Carlo method to sample from the posterior distribution of the tangent space of a Grassmann manifold. Specifically, we investigate and exploit the geometric structure of this manifold to make the proposed method applicable for other manifolds.
