We propose a new method for smoothly interpolating a given set of data points on Grassmann and Stiefel manifolds using a generalization of the De Casteljau algorithm. To that end, we reduce interpolation problem to the classical Euclidean setting, allowing us to directly leverage the extensive toolbox of spline interpolation. The interpolated curve enjoy a number of nice properties: The solution exists and is optimal in many common situations. For applications, the structures with respect to chosen Riemannian metrics are detailed resulting in additional computational advantages.
