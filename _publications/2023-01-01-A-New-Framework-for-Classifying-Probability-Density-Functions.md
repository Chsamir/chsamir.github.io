This paper introduces a new framework for classifying probability density
 functions. The proposed method fits in the class of constrained Gaussian 
processes indexed by distribution functions. Firstly, instead of 
classifying observations directly, we consider their isometric 
transformations which enables us to satisfy both positiveness and unit 
integral hard constraints. Secondly, we introduce the theoretical 
proprieties and give numerical details of how to decompose each 
transformed observation in an appropriate orthonormal basis. As a 
result, we show that the coefficients are belonging to the unit sphere 
when equipped with the standard Euclidean metric as a natural metric. 
Lastly, the proposed methods are illustrated and successfully evaluated
 in different configurations and with various dataset.
