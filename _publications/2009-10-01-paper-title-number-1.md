This paper solve the optimization problem of spline interpolations on $$\mathcal {P}$$ , the space of probability density functions. Given a finite set of $$n+1$$ distinct time instants $$t_i$$ and corresponding observation points $$p_i \in \mathcal {P}$$ , we consider the general problem of estimating a spline as a special regularized function $$\gamma $$ on $$\mathcal {P}$$ with $$\gamma (t_i)=p_i$$ . In particular, we focus on estimating missing data using smooth temporal splines to overcome the discrete nature of observations. In addition to generalizing splines on $$\mathcal {P}$$ with minimal squared-norm of the acceleration, we give numerical schemes for solving $$C^1$$ and $$C^2$$ splines from data points $$p_i \in \mathcal {P}$$ . The two solutions are then shown to be computationally efficient, geometrically simpler, extensible, and can be transposed to other spaces and applications.
