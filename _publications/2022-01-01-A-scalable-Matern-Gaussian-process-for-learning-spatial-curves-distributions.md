Data points on Riemannian manifolds are fundamental objects in many
applications and fields. Representations include shapes from biology and
medical imaging, directions and rotations from robots. This paper
addresses the problem of nonparametric regression on shapes 
when only few observations are available. In particular, we consider
the problem of classifying unobserved 3D open parametrized curves using a continuous
stochastic process to overcome the discrete nature of observations.
The proposed method has a practical objective, characterizing
populations of cochlear curves. The numerical
solution is geometrically simpler, extensible and can be generalized
for other applications. We illustrate and discuss the successful behavior of the
proposed approach with various and multiple experimental results.
