We study the cochlear spiral-shaped cavity in the temporal bone’s petrous part, which poses unique challenges related to shape and sex differences from early and modern fossil hominins, especially in juvenile. We use statistical learning models on Riemannian manifolds to classify cochlear shapes efficiently.
