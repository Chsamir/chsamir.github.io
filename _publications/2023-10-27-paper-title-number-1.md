We study the cochlear spiral-shaped cavity in the temporal boneâ€™s petrous part. The main challenges are related to shape and sex differences from early and modern fossil hominins, especially in juvenile. We use some recent statistical learning models on Riemannian manifolds to classify cochlear shapes.
