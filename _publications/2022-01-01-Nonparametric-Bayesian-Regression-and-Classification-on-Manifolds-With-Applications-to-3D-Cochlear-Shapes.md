 In this paper,  we study the cochlear spiral-shaped cavity within the petrous part of the temporal bone. This problem is particularly challenging  due to the relationship between the shape and gender, especially for children. We introduce a novel learning-based method that uses advances in shape analysis of curves and statistical modeling to perform regression and classification on cochlear shapes. Advanced shape analysis studies such as regression and  classification  are performed on  curved manifolds which make the standard formulations fail to reach good performances. Focusing on cochlear shapes, we introduce a novel framework to overcome these limitations by avoiding inference  on infinite-dimensional spaces when using a Bayesian inference with spherical Gaussian processes decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic  and real data  show improved performance to related state-of-the-art methods.
