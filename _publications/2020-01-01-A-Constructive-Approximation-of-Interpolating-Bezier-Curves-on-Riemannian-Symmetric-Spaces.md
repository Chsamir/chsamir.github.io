We propose a new method to approximate curves that interpolate a given 
set of time-labeled data on Riemannian symmetric spaces. First, we 
present our new formulation on the Euclidean space as a result of 
minimizing the mean square acceleration. This motivates its 
generalization on some Riemannian symmetric manifolds. Indeed, we 
generalize the proposed solution to the the special orthogonal group, 
the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, and Riemannian *n*-manifolds
 with constant negative curvature. By means of this generalization, we 
are able to prove that the approximates enjoy a number of nice 
properties: The solution exists and is optimal in many common 
situations. Several examples are provided together with some 
applications and graphical representations.
