A short description: 
- Introduce a new manifold structure for the space of PDFs.
- Apply constrained GP to learn and infer on PDF.
- Extend to CDFs.
- Use spherical HMC sampling to solve the posterior probability on coefficients.
- A framework that can be generalized to other manifolds.
- Some applications in medical
