**About me:**

I am an Associate Professor (HDR) at the University of Clermont Auvergne (UCA) and member of LIMOS (CNRS UMR 6158) Laboratory, France.

My main research interests involve:

    Optimization on Manifolds
    Machine Learning
    Artificial Intelligence
    Statistical Shape Analysis: Functional, curves, surfaces, 4D, etc.
    Inference, Regression and Classification on high Dimension and Manifold Embedding
    Spatio-temporal Gaussian processes
    Dynamics and Functional Patterns Analysis

With different applications to real world probelms : Medical, Paleontology, Indiustrial Artificial Vision, Data Science, etc.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
